<h3>Duality Series</h3>

<h4>Duality Figure 1</h4>

<p>Figure 1 of my duality series is the visual representation of death interacting with life. This is not the moment when death collects this life, but rather a snippet of death nurturing and watching from afar. Despite every living being having this inherent fear of death, I have this belief that death loves life. Quite possibly death is in love with life. And why wouldn't death be in love with life? Life is just so beautiful.</p>

<h4>Duality Figure 2</h4>

<p>Figure 2 of my duality series is of a dream stepping into reality. The dreamer is a sensitive artist who has worked himself into a slumber. The dreamer's enlarged eye, enhanced for the sake of showing the act of the dream coming true, mimics a thought bubble.  The dream itself is how dreams tend to be: strange, somewhat scary, and with a life of its own. This dream was lucky enough to come true.</p>

<h4>Duality Figure 3</h4>

<p>Figure 3 of my duality series features the mascot of destruction and creation, the phoenix. What I present here is how this mythological being would function in a modern world. Yes the phoenix defies death, but at what cost? Its life. The phoenix only has a one in seven chance of being free because the 7-sided die of public service decides its fate. Also? The system is rigged, because the majority of the rolls of the 7-sided die will have the phoenix take on two functions for society's benefit.</p>

<h3>Illustrations and Sketches</h3>

<h4>Dream of the Endless</h4>

<p>Dream of the Endless is the protagonist of the graphic novel series The Sandman by Neil Gaiman. I plan on making an animated short of the series, mimicking intro sequences of anime as if The Sandman has been adapted into an animated series. I sketched this out in order to practice drawing out Dream</p>

<h4>Yoga Girl</h4>

<p>I submitted this piece to a design contest at 99Designs. A business that promoted yoga opened up submissions for character concepts for a new mascot.</p>

<h4>Here Comes a YASS</h4>

<p>"Here Comes a YASS" is an illustration featuring characters from the television show Steven Universe, created by the amazingly talented Rebecca Sugar. The show features a race of women called gems, who are embodiments of gemstones whose bodies are formed from light. Steven Universe is not shy in representing all sorts of characters, be it different body types and different races and those in the LGBTQ+ community. Garnet (left) is a fusion of two gems who are so in love that they remained fused at all times. The titular Steven Universe and his female best friend Connie Maheswaran fuse into Stevonnie (right) a non-gender conforming individual. The piece is called "Here Comes a YASS" in reference to the song "Here Comes a Thought," which Garnet sings to Stevonnie to help them deal with their anxieties in order to remain a stable fusion.</p>

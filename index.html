<h1>Review of Rosalarian Website</h1>

<p>On initial view I find that <a href="https://rosalarian.com/"> queer artist Rosalarian's website</a> is solid. The navigation is clear, and the home page is laidout in a straightforward manner with her illustrations and her bio. When hovering over the navigation there are dropdown menus, which is neat. There is hoewever one flaw that I noticed right away. Being a fan of Rosalarian's comics, I clicked on the comics button on the navigation bar right away rather than selecting a specific comic, and I was led to this page:

What was otherwise a completely solid website has an uncomplete page; one loose end to a grand tapestry.

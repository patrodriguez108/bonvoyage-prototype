<h3>Bon Voyage</h3>

<div class="hi">


Hello and welcome. Here there be art.

</div>

<div class="this">

I make art that present stories within stories. Art that comes from absorbing atmosphere and leaking it out of my head. It's really weird.

</div>

<div id="footer">

While I am beginning to venture out into digital art, I try my best to stay close to traditional art (i.e. physical media)
